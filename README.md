# Wild Medicinal Leaf Classification Using CNN (MobileNetV2)

A deep learning-based system for classifying **21 wild medicinal leaf species** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with **MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning**.

This project aims to support AI-driven botanical research and medicinal plant identification — focusing on flora native to Tamil Nadu, India.

- **Data Augmentation** to overcome class imbalance
- **MobileNetV2** fine-tuned for classification
- Achieved **94% accuracy**
- Confusion matrix + performance evaluation included
- Maps predictions to **medicinal uses** (knowledge integration)
- Modular and scalable training pipeline

## Dataset Details

| Item | Value |
|------|------|
| Total images | 3,000+ |
| Classes | 21 medicinal plant species |
| Collected from | Tamil Nadu, India |
| Format | JPG / PNG |
| Storage size | ~30.5 GB |

## Model Architecture

- Pretrained **MobileNetV2** base
- Global Average Pooling Layer
- Dense Layer (512 neurons)
- Dropout for regularization
- Final Softmax (21 classes)

>Input → MobileNetV2 → GAP → Dense(512) → Dropout → Dense(21) → Output
